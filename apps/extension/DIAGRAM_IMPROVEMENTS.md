# Interactive Diagram Improvements

## Summary
All requested improvements have been successfully implemented in the `interactive-diagram-improved.js` file.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Edge Connectors at Box Borders ‚úÖ
- Edges now connect at the intersection points of box borders instead of centers
- Implemented `calculateEdgePoints()` function that calculates proper intersection points
- Edges dynamically adjust when nodes are moved

### 2. Right Sidebar with Message Attribute Form ‚úÖ
- Added properties panel in the right sidebar
- When a message node is selected, a form appears with:
  - Text input for message content
  - Textarea for description
  - Dynamic suggestion fields
  - Save button to apply changes
- Form updates are immediately reflected in the diagram

### 3. Removed 'end' from Node Palette ‚úÖ
- The node palette now only shows:
  - üìù Message
  - ‚≠ê Rich Card
- End nodes are no longer available as RCL doesn't use explicit end nodes

### 4. Separate Start Node from Starting Message ‚úÖ
- Start node is now rendered as a distinct green circle
- Starting message appears as a regular message node
- They are connected with an edge showing the flow

### 5. Match Construct as Compound Node ‚úÖ
- Match nodes are rendered as special compound nodes with:
  - Header showing the match expression
  - Multiple sub-options as clickable rectangles
  - Each option can have its own outgoing connection
  - Visual distinction with rounded corners and different styling

### 6. Connection Remapping ‚úÖ
- Added connection ports (small circles) at node edges
- Drag-and-drop connection creation:
  - Click and drag from any port to create new connections
  - Existing connections can be remapped by dragging their endpoints
  - Visual feedback during dragging with dashed lines
  - Connection mode toggle button in toolbar

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added:
- `renderMatchNode()` - Creates compound match nodes with sub-options
- `calculateEdgePoints()` - Calculates border intersection points
- `showNodeProperties()` - Displays and manages the properties form
- `handleConnectionDrag()` - Manages connection remapping
- `createConnectionPorts()` - Adds interactive connection points

### CSS Enhancements:
- Match node styling with sub-option hover effects
- Connection port animations
- Temporary connection line animations
- Form styling for the properties panel

## Usage

1. **Creating Connections**: Click the üîó button to enter connection mode, then click and drag between nodes
2. **Editing Messages**: Select any message node to see its properties in the right sidebar
3. **Match Nodes**: Each option in a match node can have its own outgoing connection
4. **Remapping**: Hover over connection ports and drag to remap connections

## File Changes
- Modified: `client/resources/interactive-diagram-improved.js` (complete rewrite)
- Modified: `client/resources/sprotty-diagram.css` (added styles for new features)
- Modified: `client/src/interactiveDiagramProvider.ts` (updated to use improved script)
- Removed: References to "end" nodes in the palette

The interactive diagram now provides a much more intuitive and feature-rich experience for RCL flow visualization and editing.
