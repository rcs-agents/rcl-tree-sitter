# Interactive Diagram - Final Status

## ✅ Consolidated Implementation

The interactive diagram has been consolidated into **ONE JS file** and **ONE CSS file** as requested:

### Files:
- `client/resources/interactive-diagram.js` - Complete implementation with all fixes
- `client/resources/interactive-diagram.css` - Main diagram styles  
- `client/resources/sprotty-diagram.css` - Enhanced styles for new features

### Removed Files:
- ❌ `interactive-diagram-enhanced.js`
- ❌ `interactive-diagram-improved.js`  
- ❌ `interactive-diagram-fixed.js`
- ❌ `test-diagram.html`

## ✅ All Bugs Fixed

### 1. Node Dragging ✅
- Nodes can now be moved by clicking and dragging
- Connected edges update automatically during drag
- Proper cursor feedback (move → grabbing)

### 2. Connection/Edge Dragging ✅  
- Connections can be created by dragging between nodes
- Connection mode toggle button (🔗) 
- Visual feedback with dashed temporary lines
- Connection ports appear on hover in connection mode

### 3. Arrow Size ✅
- Reduced arrow markers from 15x10 to 10x7 pixels
- Proper proportional sizing with stroke width
- Clean, professional appearance

### 4. Text Selection ✅
- All text is now non-selectable via CSS and inline styles
- Text editing through properties panel when node is selected
- No accidental text selection during interactions

## ✅ Enhanced Features

### Core Improvements:
- **Border-based edge connections** - Edges connect at box borders, not centers
- **Right sidebar properties panel** - Edit message attributes with forms
- **No 'end' nodes** - Removed from palette (RCL doesn't use explicit end nodes)
- **Separate start nodes** - Pure start circle separate from initial message
- **Match construct compound nodes** - Visual representation with sub-options
- **Connection remapping** - Drag ports to remap connections

### Technical Implementation:
- Modern for...of loops instead of forEach
- Proper Number.parseInt/parseFloat usage
- Non-selectable text styling
- Efficient edge recalculation during drag
- Smooth cubic bezier edge curves
- Intersection-based edge endpoints

## Usage

### Moving Nodes:
Click and drag any node to reposition it. Connected edges update automatically.

### Creating Connections:
1. Click the 🔗 button to enter connection mode
2. Click and drag from one node to another
3. Press Escape to exit connection mode

### Editing Messages:
1. Click any message node to select it
2. Use the properties panel on the right to edit text and suggestions
3. Click "Save Changes" to apply

### Match Nodes:
Each option in a match construct can have its own outgoing connection for complex branching logic.
