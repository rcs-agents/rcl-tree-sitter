                                We believe the ultimate driving experience happens in a bond between driver and car, but there is also a third part of this equation: the road. You deserve to see the paths carved everywhere around the world through the best possible light. There are many variables that affect this experience, that's why BMW works to protect the environment that hosts the landscapes you watch through your window.
                                The work of today is the energy of tomorrow, and that energy will power us through roads of a cleaner world.

                                As you explore our initiatives, you'll notice references to several of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN's Agenda 2030. This global action plan guides us toward a more livable future, and at BMW, we are committed to making a meaningful impact in achieving these goals.

                                BMW aims to establish a circular economy that enables high-quality recycling. We continuously look for and implement ways to improve our recycling processes, no matter how small, because every possibility can make a difference.

                                We are fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To get there, we've set ambitious, science-based targets to cut CO₂e emissions by at least 40 million tonnes by 2030 compared to 2019.

                                Our efforts include ramping up sales of fully electric vehicles, which rose from 215,752 in 2022 to 426,594 in 2024. We expect at least 50% of global sales to be fully electric by 2030, putting about 10 million electric BMWs on the road.

                                Every journey on the road is shaped by countless people, and their rights also deserve protection. That's why BMW is committed to safeguarding human rights throughout the entire supply chain, long before materials arrive at our factories. This is how we take responsibility at every step to build a truly circular world. Discover more about our efforts in these countries:

                                Raw material extraction affects workers throughout the entire supply chain, not just those closest to the BMW Group. We are committed to caring for both the materials in our vehicles and the people who extract them, recognizing that ethical responsibility goes beyond supply: it's about people.

                                BMW Group participates in multiple initiatives to promote responsible raw material management and ensures environmental and social compliance through a rigorous, multi-stage due diligence process.

                                The "Cobalt for Development (C4D)" project is an initiative that aims to formalize artisanal and small-scale cobalt mining (ASM) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, specifically in the Kolwezi region of Lualaba Province.

                                The Democratic Republic of Congo holds the world's largest cobalt reserves and leads global production. Approximately 20% of its cobalt is extracted through artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), which, despite its inherent risks, remains a vital source of income for the region. Over one million people depend on ASM, making it one of the region's most significant livelihoods.

                                In Lualaba Province, widespread poverty means many rely on artisanal mining as their main, though precarious, source of income. The absence of viable alternatives deepens dependence on mining and limits household savings.
                                *C4D supports access to education and the development of alternative livelihoods, such as farming and small businesses, empowering families to diversify their income and strengthen financial resilience.*
                                Although primary schooling is officially free, costs for books and uniforms often prevent attendance. Many children leave school early to support their families, fueling child labor in mines.
                                *C4D promotes education by supporting school construction, teacher training, and initiatives that help children stay in school, reducing reliance on child labor.*

                                The Responsible Lithium Partnership, supported by BMW Group, is a multi-stakeholder initiative promoting sustainable lithium extraction in Chile's Salar de Atacama. This region, part of the Lithium Triangle, holds vast lithium reserves but faces environmental risks, especially to local water sources and fragile ecosystems, due to extraction methods.

                                Lithium is crucial for batteries, but protecting drinking water and the environment is equally important. The initiative focuses on sustainable mining practices, open dialogue, and cooperation among local communities, indigenous groups, and mining companies to balance resource needs with ecosystem and community protection.

                                The Living Rubber project in Sumatra, Indonesia, focuses on protecting Hutan Harapan. This is the island's last large lowland rainforest on mineral soil, spanning about 100,000 hectares. This unique forest is home to hundreds of rare species, including critically endangered Sumatran tigers, Asian elephants, and hornbills.

                                Since 2007, local communities, PT Restoration Ecosystem Indonesia (PT REKI, a legal entity of Burung Indonesia), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), BirdLife International, and KfW Development Bank (2019–2026) have worked together to protect and restore Hutan Harapan. The project contributes to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) and is supported by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV).

                                We aim to lower CO₂e emissions and minimize the environmental and social impacts of raw material extraction.

                                **Maximizing Resource Efficiency**
                                We keep materials in use as long as possible, maintaining their value in a continuous cycle.

                                **Design for Circularity**
                                We integrate circular design by using more recycled materials without compromising quality or safety, selecting materials for easy recovery, and designing components for simple, cost-effective disassembly and recycling.

                                For over 30 years, our Recycling and Dismantling Centre (RDZ) has developed advanced recycling processes, directly influencing new vehicle design. We work with global partners and maintain a recycling database used by 3,000 businesses in 23 countries to guide efficient dismantling and material recovery.

                                **Battery Recycling**
                                Since late 2024, our closed-loop battery system recovers and reuses critical materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium, feeding them back into new battery production.

                                We have consistently reduced non-recyclable waste and water consumption per vehicle, water use dropped from 1.90 m³ in 2022 to 1.67 m³ in 2024, and non-recyclable waste from 2.74 kg to 1.68 kg.

                                Through these measures, we are building a more sustainable future, one innovation at a time.

                                Throughout history, humanity has always lived for "firsts". From the moment we lightened our load with the invention of the wheel, every breakthrough set us on a path of invention, each new "first" building on the last, sometimes in leaps, sometimes in small but vital steps.

                                Since the turn of the millennium, digital innovation has accelerated at an unprecedented pace, transforming the way we live and drive. The journey that began with a wheel led to the very first car, and now, our cars have crossed a new threshold, blending mechanical mastery with digital brilliance.

                                Sheer driving pleasure isn't just preserved, it's reimagined, expanded, and electrified by every new breakthrough. At BMW, we live for these moments. Every innovation, every "first," is another chapter in our story. We are always moving forward, always driven by joy.
